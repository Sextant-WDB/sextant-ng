#Microanalytics for a JavaScript world

Sextant is a minimal set of tracking metrics for web apps running on AngularJS. Getting started is simple: register an account, specify the domain you&rsquo;d like to track (don&rsquo;t leave out the http(s):!), and copy the tracking script into the &lt;head&gt; of your app. Then make sure it&rsquo;working: fire up your app, click around, and take a look at your dashboard!
